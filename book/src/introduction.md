# Introduction

`ratatui` is a terminal UI library that supports multiple backends:

* [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) [default]
* [termion](https://github.com/ticki/termion)
* [termwiz](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/tree/master/termwiz)

The library is based on the principle of immediate rendering with intermediate buffers. This means
that at each new frame you should build all widgets that are supposed to be part of the UI. While
providing a great flexibility for rich and interactive UI, this may introduce overhead for highly
dynamic content. So, the implementation try to minimize the number of ansi escapes sequences
generated to draw the updated UI. In practice, given the speed of `Rust` the overhead rather comes
from the terminal emulator than the library itself.

Moreover, the library does not provide any input handling nor any event system and you may rely on
the previously cited libraries to achieve such features.
