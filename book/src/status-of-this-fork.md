# Status of this fork

In response to the original maintainer [**Florian Dehau**](https://github.com/fdehau)'s issue
regarding the [future of `tui-rs`](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/654), several members of
the community forked the project and created this crate. We look forward to continuing the work
started by Florian ðŸš€

In order to organize ourselves, we currently use a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pMCEU9hNEj),
feel free to join and come chat! There are also plans to implement a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
bridge in the near future. **Discord is not a MUST to contribute**. We follow a pretty standard
github centered open source workflow keeping the most important conversations on GitHub, open an
issue or PR and it will be addressed. ðŸ˜„

Please make sure you read the updated [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, especially if
you are interested in working on a PR or issue opened in the previous repository.
